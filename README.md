### About our model
Our Machine Learning model is created for shopping platforms. It predicts whether a given user’s session will end with a purchase after offering an appropriate discount. We implemented two algorithms using Python: Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Therefore we conduct the A/B test in our app and collect data for the further analysis. In general, we focused on maximizing F1-score because our training set is unbalanced and we couldn’t focus on the accuracy, since high accuracy didn’t tell us as much as precision or recall in this case. If you are interested in the details, check our GitHub repository and provided Notebook in it.

### About us
We are third year Computer Science students at Warsaw University of Technology. This is our project for the course called Machine learning engineering. We are both interested in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science, since we put a lot of time and effort into this project.
